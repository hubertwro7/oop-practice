# OOP Practice Repository (C#)

This repository is dedicated for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C#.

The tasks provided in this repository are based on a set of programming exercises available at [this link.](https://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/anstroinski/data/uploads/mipo/materials/mipo-programowanie-obiektowe-w-c-zadania.pdf)

<sub>The exercises cover a range of OOP topics, providing targeted practice to enhance my skills and prepare me for my upcoming test at __WSEI Krak√≥w__. EDIT: passed :)</sub>
